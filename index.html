    During the proof of concept phase of Spenderino, we don't use a database. That means that any information that you provide to us will be deleted when the service reboots. Due to our host rebooting the service after 30 minutes of inactivity.<br><br>

    This phase will last until 2021-03-31 at the very latest. In the very unlikely event of the service running uninterrupted for the length of the phase, its end will finally result in deletion of all data.<br><br>

    The only data collected during the test are emails, passwords (which are stored safely according to current best practices), aliases and donation metadata. We do not collect credit card information at any point.<br><br>

    You do not have to supply valid email addresses since there's no email service configured, so feel free to use dummy information. Be advised that real credit card information will not work at any stage during the proof of concept phase, so please use the test card data that is provided inside the app.<br><br>
